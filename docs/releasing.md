# cluster-api-provider-metal3 releasing

This document details the steps to create a release for
`cluster-api-provider-metal3` aka CAPM3.

## Before making a release

Things you should do before making a release:

- Check the
  [Metal3 release process](https://github.com/metal3-io/metal3-docs/blob/main/processes/releasing.md)
  for high-level process and possible follow-up actions
- Uplift controller Go modules to use latest corresponding CAPI modules
- Uplift BMO's `apis` and `pkg/hardwareutils` dependencies
- Uplift IPAM `api` dependency,
  [container image version](https://github.com/metal3-io/cluster-api-provider-metal3/blob/main/config/ipam/image_patch.yaml),
  and [manifest resource](https://github.com/metal3-io/cluster-api-provider-metal3/blob/main/config/ipam/kustomization.yaml)
- Uplift any other direct/indirect dependency to close any public
  vulnerabilities

## Permissions

Creating a release requires repository `write` permissions for:

- Tag pushing
- Branch creation
- GitHub Release publishing

These permissions are implicit for the org admins and repository admins.
Release team member gets his/her permissions via `metal3-release-team`
membership. This GitHub team has the required permissions in each repository
required to release CAPM3. Adding person to the team gives him/her the necessary
rights  in all relevant repositories in the organization. Individual persons
should not be given permissions directly.

## Process

CAPM3 uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org). For version `v1.x.y`:

### Repository setup

Clone the repository:
`git clone git@github.com:metal3-io/cluster-api-provider-metal3`

or if using existing repository, verify your intended remote is set to
`metal3-io`: `git remote -v`. For this document, we assume it is `origin`.

- If creating a new minor branch, identify the commit you wish to create the
  branch from, and create a branch `release-1.x`:
  `git checkout <sha> -b release-1.x` and push it to remote:
  `git push origin release-1.x` to create it
- If creating a new patch release, use existing branch `release-1.x`:
  `git checkout origin/release-1.x`

### Tags

First we create a primary release tag, that triggers release note creation and
image building processes.

- Create a signed, annotated tag with: `git tag -s -a v1.x.y -m v1.x.y`
- Push the tags to the GitHub repository: `git push origin v1.x.y`

This triggers two things:

- GitHub action workflow for automated release process creates a draft release
  in GitHub repository with correct content, comparing the pushed tag to
  previous tag
- Quay starts building release image with the release tag

We also need to create one or more tags for the Go modules ecosystem:

- For any subdirectory with `go.mod` in it (excluding `hack/tools`), create
  another Git tag with directory prefix, ie.
  `git tag -s api/v1.x.y -m api/v1.x.y`.
  For CAPM3, these directories are: `api` and `test`. This enables the
  tags to be used as a Go module version for any downstream users.
  **NOTE**: Do not create annotated tags for go modules.

### Release artifacts

We need to verify all release artifacts are correctly built or generated by
the release workflow. For a release, we should have the following artifacts:

Git tags pushed:

- Primary release tag: `v1.x.y`
- Go module tags: `api/v1.x.y`, `test/v1.x.y`

Container images built and tagged at Quay registry:

- [cluster-api-provider-metal3:v1.x.y](https://quay.io/repository/metal3-io/cluster-api-provider-metal3?tab=tags)

Files included in the release page:

- A manifest file - `infrastructure-components.yaml`
- A metadata file - `metadata.yaml`
- A cluster template - `cluster-template.yaml`
- A file containing an example of variables to set - `example_variables.rc`

### Release notes

Next step is to clean up the release note manually.

- Check for duplicates, reverts, and incorrect classifications of PRs, and
  whatever release creation tagged to be manually checked.
- For any superseded PRs (like CAPI uplifts, or commit revertions) that provide
  no value to the release, create a summary line in `Superseded` section with
  the PR ids and summary title. This way the changes are acknowledged to be part
  of the release, but not overwhelming the important changes contained by the
  release.
- If the release you're making is not a new major release, new minor release,
  or a new patch release from the latest release branch, uncheck the box for
  latest release.
- If it is a release candidate (RC) or a pre-release, tick pre-release box.
- Publish the release.

## Post-release actions for new release branches

Some post-release actions are needed if new minor or major branch was created.

### Branch protection rules

Branch protection rules need to be applied to the new release branch. Copy the
settings after the previous release branch, with the exception of
`Required tests` selection. Required tests can only be selected after new
keywords are implemented in Jenkins JJB, and project-infra, and have been run
at least once in the PR targeting the branch in question.

### Update README.md and build badges

Update `README.md` with release specific information, both on `main` and
in the new `release-1.x` branch as necessary.

[Example](https://github.com/metal3-io/cluster-api-provider-metal3/pull/949)

In the `release-1.x` branch, update the build badges in the `README.md` to point
to correct Jenkins jobs, so the build statuses of the release branch are
visible.

[Example](https://github.com/metal3-io/cluster-api-provider-metal3/pull/951)

## Additional actions outside this repository

Further additional actions are required in the Metal3 project after CAPM3
release. For that, please continue following the instructions provided in
[Metal3 release process](https://github.com/metal3-io/metal3-docs/blob/main/processes/releasing.md)
